## ðŸŒŸ BEGINNER LEVEL: House Price Prediction
- **Overview:** Predict house prices using a simple linear regression model based on square footage.
- **Dataset:** [House Prices Dataset](link_to_dataset)
- **Instructions:** Handle missing data, implement regression with NumPy and scikit-learn, split data, train model, evaluate with Mean Squared Error, and visualise using matplotlib or seaborn.

## ðŸ“§ INTERMEDIATE LEVEL: Spam Email Classification
- **Overview:** Classify emails as spam or not using advanced text classification techniques.
- **Dataset:** [Spam Email Dataset](link_to_dataset)
- **Instructions:** Preprocess text data, implement classification algorithms like Naive Bayes or SVM with NLTK or scikit-learn, evaluate using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## âœ¨ ADVANCED LEVEL: Handwritten Digit Recognition
- **Overview:** Build a state-of-the-art CNN to recognise handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- **Dataset:** [MNIST Dataset](link_to_dataset)
- **Instructions:** Preprocess images, implement CNN architecture using TensorFlow or PyTorch, evaluate using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
